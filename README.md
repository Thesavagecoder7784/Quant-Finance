## Black-Scholes Algorithm
Helps you calculate the fair price of a stock option (basically tells you how much a stock option should cost)
Traders use this formula to find the ideal price of a European Call or Put option

## Monte Carlo Algorithm
Randomized method to estimate complex things (for example, the value of an option) by simulating a lot of future possible scenarios (thousands and millions)
This is done by calculating the payoff and then using that to get the average value
