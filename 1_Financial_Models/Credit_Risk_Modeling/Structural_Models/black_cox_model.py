# black_cox_model.py

"""
Implementation of the Black-Cox model for corporate default.

The Black-Cox model is a structural credit risk model that extends the Merton model
by incorporating a barrier for default. Default occurs when the firm's asset value
drops to a pre-specified barrier level before the maturity of the debt.

This file will contain functions for:
- Calculating the probability of default under the Black-Cox model.
- Pricing corporate debt using the Black-Cox framework.

    """
    Calculates the probability of default under the Black-Cox model.

    Args:
        V0 (float): Current firm asset value.
        K (float): Face value of debt (default barrier).
        T (float): Time to maturity of debt (in years).
        sigma (float): Volatility of firm asset value.
        r (float): Risk-free interest rate.
        L (float): Default barrier level (e.g., a percentage of K, or a fixed value).
        t (float): Current time (default is 0).

    Returns:
        float: Probability of default.

    # This is a simplified placeholder. The actual Black-Cox formula is more complex
    # and involves solving for the first passage time to a barrier.
    # For a more accurate implementation, one would need to consider the specific
    # boundary conditions and solve the relevant partial differential equation
    # or use numerical methods.

    # As a basic approximation (similar to Merton, but with a barrier concept):
    # d1 and d2 are typically used in option pricing, but here we adapt the concept
    # for a barrier model. This is NOT the full Black-Cox solution.
    # The true Black-Cox involves reflections and more complex integrals.

    # Placeholder for a more complex calculation:
    # For now, let's use a simplified approach that assumes default if V0 drops below L
    # within time T, similar to a down-and-out option.

    # This is a highly simplified representation and does not fully capture the Black-Cox model.
    # A proper implementation would involve solving the PDE or using advanced numerical methods.
    # For demonstration, we'll use a simplified barrier crossing probability.

    # d1 = (np.log(V0 / L) + (r + 0.5 * sigma**2) * T) / (sigma * np.sqrt(T))

    # The actual Black-Cox probability of default is more involved, often given by
    # P(V_T < K or V_t < L for some t < T)

    # For a simple barrier crossing probability (first passage time to L):
    # This is still a simplification, but closer to the spirit of a barrier model.
    # It's related to the probability that a geometric Brownian motion hits a barrier.

    # for a geometric Brownian motion. It's a component of Black-Cox, but not the full PD.
