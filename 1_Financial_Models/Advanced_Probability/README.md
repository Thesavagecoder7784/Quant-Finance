# Advanced Probability in Financial Markets

This directory contains Python scripts demonstrating advanced probability concepts and their applications in financial markets. These concepts are fundamental for understanding complex financial models and derivatives pricing.

## Contents

- **Conditional Expectation in Financial Markets.py:**
  This script explores the concept of conditional expectation, a crucial tool in financial modeling for pricing derivatives, risk management, and understanding how information affects asset prices.

- **Martingales in Financial Markets.py:**
  This script demonstrates martingale processes, which are central to arbitrage-free pricing theory in financial markets. Martingales are used to model fair games and are essential for understanding risk-neutral pricing.

- **Girsanov_Theorem_in_Finance.py:**
  This script provides a conceptual and numerical demonstration of Girsanov's Theorem. This theorem is a cornerstone of quantitative finance, providing the mathematical foundation for switching between the real-world and risk-neutral probability measures, which is essential for arbitrage-free derivative pricing.

- **Feynman_Kac_Theorem.py:**
  This script demonstrates the Feynman-Kac theorem, which provides a crucial bridge between partial differential equations (PDEs) and the expected value of stochastic processes. It shows why the solution to the Black-Scholes PDE can be found by calculating the expected discounted payoff of a derivative, linking the worlds of PDEs and Monte Carlo simulations.
