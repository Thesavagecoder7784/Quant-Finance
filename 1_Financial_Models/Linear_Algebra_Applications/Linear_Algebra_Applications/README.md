# Linear Algebra Applications in Finance

This directory contains implementations of linear algebra algorithms with applications in quantitative finance, primarily for dimensionality reduction and data analysis.

## Contents

- **pca_algorithm.py:**
  An implementation of Principal Component Analysis (PCA). PCA is used for dimensionality reduction, identifying key risk factors, and noise reduction in financial datasets by transforming correlated variables into a set of linearly uncorrelated principal components.

- **svd_algorithm.py:**
  An implementation of Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). SVD is a powerful matrix factorization technique used for dimensionality reduction, noise reduction, and solving linear systems in financial data analysis. It's a generalization of eigenvalue decomposition.

- **main.py:**
  A script demonstrating the usage of the PCA and SVD algorithms implemented in this directory.
