Sharpe Ratio: Higher is better, indicates better risk-adjusted return (total risk).
Sortino Ratio: Higher is better, focuses on downside risk.
Maximum Drawdown: Closer to 0 is better, indicates less severe losses from peak.
Calmar Ratio: Higher is better, measures return relative to max drawdown.
Beta: >1 more volatile than market, <1 less volatile, =1 moves with market.
Jensen's Alpha: Positive means portfolio outperformed CAPM's expected return.
Treynor Ratio: Higher is better, measures return relative to systematic risk.
Value at Risk (VaR): Estimates worst expected loss over a time frame at a confidence level.
CAGR: Smoothed average annual growth rate over the investment period.
