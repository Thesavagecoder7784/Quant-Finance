# Comprehensive Portfolio Performance and Risk Analytics
Explains key metrics used to evaluate investment portfolio performance and risk, providing a more comprehensive view than just raw returns.

## Metrics
1. Sharpe Ratio
A metric used to assess the performance of an investment by measuring its risk-adjusted return. Indicates the extra return given based on the unit risk taken

Sharpe Ratio = (Rx - Rf)/StdDev Rx

- Rx: Expected Portfolio Return
- Rf: Risk Free Return
- StdDev Rx: Standard Deviation of portfolio return/volatility
  
2. Sortino Ratio
Risk-adjusted performance measure that focuses on downside risk, indicating how much excess return an investment generates for each unit of downside risk. It's a modification of the Sharpe ratio. Still, unlike the Sharpe ratio, it only considers the standard deviation of negative returns when calculating risk, making it particularly useful for risk-averse investors.

3. Maximum Drawdown (MDD)
A risk management metric that quantifies the largest peak-to-trough decline in the value of an investment portfolio or trading account over a specific period. It is the worst-case scenario of losses until the portfolio reaches a new high.

Maximum Drawdown = (Trough Value - Peak Value) / Peak Value 

4. Calmar Ratio
Risk-adjusted performance measure that assesses the potential return of an investment relative to its maximum drawdown, which is the largest peak-to-trough decline during a specific period. Used to evaluate the performance of investments, particularly in hedge funds and commodity trading advisors.

Calmar Ratio = Average Annual Rate of Return / Maximum Drawdown

5. Beta (β)
Measures a stock's volatility relative to the overall market. Indicates how much a stock's price tends to move compared to the market as a whole.

Beta = (E(Rs) - Rf)/ E(Rm) - Rf  (or) Covariance(Portfolio Returns, Market Returns) / Variance(Market Returns)

- E(Rs): Expected return from investment
- E(Rm): Expected return from market
- Rf: Risk-free Return 

6. Jensen's Alpha (α)
Determines the abnormal return of a security or portfolio of securities over the theoretical expected return. Helps calculate the excess return that is generated by the portfolio over the anticipated return, and this is predicted by the CAPM (capital asset pricing model)

α = Rp - (Rf - β(Rm - Rf))

- Rp: Portfolio Return
- Rf: Risk-Free Return
- Rm: Expected Market Return
- β: Portfolio Beta

7. Treynor Ratio
Measures a portfolio's performance by evaluating the additional return generated for each unit of risk undertaken

Treynor Ratio = (Rp - Rf)/β

- Rp: Portfolio Return
- Rf: Risk-Free Rate
- β: Portfolio Beta

8. Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR)
Rate of return that an investment would need to have every year in order to grow from its beginning balance to its ending balance, over a given time interval

CAGR = ((Ending Value / Beginning Value)^(1 / Number of Years)) - 1 

## Example output
--- Portfolio Performance & Risk Analytics ---
Period: 756 trading days (~3.0 years)
Annual Risk-Free Rate: 2.00%

1. Sharpe Ratio: -0.4522
2. Sortino Ratio: -0.7171
3. Maximum Drawdown: -0.2918 (-29.18%)
4. Calmar Ratio: -0.2335
5. Beta (vs Market): 0.0238
6. Jensen's Alpha (annualized): -0.1966
7. Treynor Ratio: -2.8578
9. CAGR (Initial: 100000.00, Final: 86240.56): -0.0481 (-4.81%)

--- Interpretation Hints ---
Sharpe Ratio: Higher is better, indicates better risk-adjusted return (total risk).
Sortino Ratio: Higher is better, focuses on downside risk.
Maximum Drawdown: Closer to 0 is better, indicates less severe losses from peak.
Calmar Ratio: Higher is better, measures return relative to max drawdown.
Beta: >1 more volatile than market, <1 less volatile, =1 moves with market.
Jensen's Alpha: Positive means portfolio outperformed CAPM's expected return.
Treynor Ratio: Higher is better, measures return relative to systematic risk.
CAGR: Smoothed average annual growth rate over the investment period.
