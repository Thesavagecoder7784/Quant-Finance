# Portfolio Optimization Models

This directory contains implementations of various portfolio optimization models, ranging from classical approaches to modern machine learning-driven techniques.

## Contents

- **Markowitz.py:**
  An implementation of the classic Markowitz Mean-Variance Optimization (MVO) model. This script allows for the construction of efficient portfolios by balancing expected return and risk, considering asset correlations.

- **Black-Litterman.py:**
  An implementation of the Black-Litterman model, an extension of Markowitz MVO. This model combines market equilibrium views with an investor's subjective views to produce more robust and intuitive asset allocations.

- **Reinforcement Learning.py:**
  A demonstration of applying Reinforcement Learning (RL) to a simplified portfolio optimization problem. This script trains an agent to learn optimal trading decisions (buy, sell, hold) in a simulated market environment to maximize portfolio value.
